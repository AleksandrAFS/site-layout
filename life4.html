          The reference implementation of Python is the CPython interpreter, which supports most actively used platforms and is the de facto language standard. 
          <br>It is distributed under the free Python Software Foundation License, which allows it to be used without restrictions in any application, including proprietary ones. CPython compiles source code into high-level bytecode, which is executed in a stack-based virtual machine.The other three main implementations of the language are Jython, IronPython and PyPy. PyPy is written in a subset of the Python language and was developed as an alternative to CPython in order to increase the speed of program execution, including through the use of JIT compilation. Support for Python 2 ended in 2020. 
          <br>Currently, the version of the Python 3 language is actively being developed. The development of the language is carried out through proposals for expanding the PEP language, which describe innovations, make adjustments based on feedback from the community, and document the final solutions.
          <br>Python is a widely-used general-purpose, high-level programming language. It was initially designed by Guido van Rossum in 1991 and developed by Python Software Foundation. It was mainly developed for emphasis on code readability, and its syntax allows programmers to express concepts in fewer lines of code.
          <br>In the late 1980s, history was about to be written. It was that time when working on Python started. Soon after that, Guido Van Rossum began doing its application-based work in December of 1989 at Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI) which is situated in the Netherlands. It was started firstly as a hobby project because he was looking for an interesting project to keep him occupied during Christmas. The programming language in which Python is said to have succeeded is ABC Programming Language, which had interfacing with the Amoeba Operating System and had the feature of exception handling. He had already helped to create ABC earlier in his career and he had seen some issues with ABC but liked most of the features. After that what he did was really very clever. He had taken the syntax of ABC, and some of its good features. It came with a lot of complaints too, so he fixed those issues completely and had created a good scripting language that had removed all the flaws. The inspiration for the name came from BBC’s TV Show – ‘Monty Python’s Flying Circus’, as he was a big fan of the TV show and also he wanted a short, unique and slightly mysterious name for his invention and hence he named it Python! He was the “Benevolent dictator for life” (BDFL) until he stepped down from the position as the leader on 12th July 2018. For quite some time he used to work for Google, but currently, he is working at Dropbox. 
          <br>The language was finally released in 1991. When it was released, it used a lot fewer codes to express the concepts, when we compare it with Java, C++ & C. Its design philosophy was quite good too. Its main objective is to provide code readability and advanced developer productivity. When it was released it had more than enough capability to provide classes with inheritance, several core data types exception handling and functions. 
          <br>Following are the illustrations of different versions of Python along with the timeline.
